ldpasswd is a simple utility to emulate the behavior of FreeBSD's passwd, which
does not (as of this writing) have support for interacting with LDAP.

The original script is located within the FreeBSD handbook here:
	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/ldap-auth/client.html#CHPW-RUBY

The addendum in the handbook should also be kept in mind here:
	Although not guaranteed to be free of security holes (the password is kept
	in memory, for example) this is cleaner and more flexible than a simple sh
	script.

Type `make help` to see the man page, which outlines the basic usage.
